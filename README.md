# RemoteSession 0.0.1 dev
A Simple Java Swing app to share and control a remote session

Always since I was a child, I wanted to know how was possible share my computer to other.

Since my Windows times, it was a question which it never was completelly resolved, and many many years after this
first question, when you live in a moment application security is so important and all comunications are encrypted
I wanted to demostrate to public it's very easy build from scratch a complete portable solution for that, and 
share it like opensource.

RemoteSession 0.0.1 at this moment is in development, but you can try to share a remote desktop to a client.

At this moment it's using 2009 port, but you can change it in the code, it's easy to find in code.

When you open the app you will have to choose:

All sessions are encrypted, so needs to put a password and this password. If you don't put a password sessions
will be encrypted with default (and vulnerable) key.

When you have an opened session you will have a little control panel, at this moment it's shown at this way
